**Business Context**

The healthcare industry is rapidly evolving, with professionals facing increasing challenges in managing vast volumes of medical data while delivering accurate and timely diagnoses. The need for quick access to comprehensive, reliable, and up-to-date medical knowledge is critical for improving patient outcomes and ensuring informed decision-making in a fast-paced environment.

Healthcare professionals often encounter information overload, struggling to sift through extensive research and data to create accurate diagnoses and treatment plans. This challenge is amplified by the need for efficiency, particularly in emergencies, where time-sensitive decisions are vital. Furthermore, access to trusted, current medical information from renowned manuals and research papers is essential for maintaining high standards of care.

To address these challenges, healthcare centers can focus on integrating systems that streamline access to medical knowledge, provide tools to support quick decision-making, and enhance efficiency. Leveraging centralized knowledge platforms and ensuring healthcare providers have continuous access to reliable resources can significantly improve patient care and operational effectiveness.

**Common Questions to Answer**

1. Diagnostic Assistance: "What are the common symptoms and treatments for pulmonary embolism?"

2. Drug Information: "Can you provide the trade names of medications used for treating hypertension?"

3. Treatment Plans: "What are the first-line options and alternatives for managing rheumatoid arthritis?"

4. Specialty Knowledge: "What are the diagnostic steps for suspected endocrine disorders?"

5. Critical Care Protocols: "What is the protocol for managing sepsis in a critical care unit?"

**Objective**

As an AI specialist, the task is to develop a RAG-based AI solution using renowned medical manuals to address healthcare challenges. The objective is to understand issues like information overload, apply AI techniques to streamline decision-making, analyze its impact on diagnostics and patient outcomes, evaluate its potential to standardize care practices, and create a functional prototype demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.

**Data Description**

The Merck Manuals are medical references published by the American pharmaceutical company Merck & Co., that cover a wide range of medical topics, including disorders, tests, diagnoses, and drugs. The manuals have been published since 1899, when Merck & Co. was still a subsidiary of the German company Merck.

The manual is provided as a PDF with over 4,000 pages divided into 23 sections.

**Solution Approach**

**Phase 1:   Baseline Model Implementation**
• Model Selection and Setup
* Deployed TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF as the foundational large language model
* Conducted preliminary testing with medical queries to establish baseline performance
* Identified limitations in domain-specific knowledge and factual precision
  
**Phase 2:   Prompt Engineering and Optimization**
• Prompt Development and Testing
* Designed specialized prompts tailored for medical query processing
* Re-evaluated the same test questions using optimized prompts
* Identified improvement in response relevance and clinical accuracy

**Phase 3: RAG System Implementation**
• Data Preparation and Vector Database
* Integrated Merck Manuals as the authoritative medical knowledge base with intelligent document chunking
* Deployed thenlper/gte-small embedding model for semantic text representation
* Built comprehensive vector database with indexed medical knowledge chunks

• Retrieval and Generation Pipeline
* Implemented semantic similarity search for relevant context retrieval
* Created seamless integration between retrieval and generation components
* Developed response synthesis methods combining retrieved knowledge with model capabilities

**Phase 4: Parameter Tuning and Optimization**
• Generation and Retrieval Parameter Optimization
* Fine-tuned temperature, top-k, and top-p parameters to balance accuracy and response diversity
* Optimized k-value (number of retrieved chunks) and similarity thresholds for comprehensive context
* Established optimal parameter combinations for different types of medical queries
  
**Phase 5: Evaluation and Validation**
• Automated Assessment Framework
* Utilized the same Mistral-7B model as an evaluator for groundedness and factual accuracy
* Implemented comprehensive relevance scoring for medical query responses
* Conducted end-to-end testing with diverse medical scenarios and established benchmark performance metrics
